# RAS-XLF-Project
This project investigates the significant excess of galaxy clusters detected at $L_X \approx 2 \times 10^{43}$ erg s $^{-1}$ in the X-ray Luminosity Function (XLF) determined using the Wide Angle $\textit{ROSAT}$ Pointed Survey (WARPS; Koens et al. 2013, hereafter K13) and the 160 Square Degree (160SD; Mullis et al. 2004) cluster catalogues.
We take advantage of the recent cluster catalogue from the first $\textit{eROSITA}$ All Sky Survey (eRASS:1; Bulbul et al. 2024) to determine whether this over-density persists.

The large eRASS:1 cluster catalogue provides an independent dataset with which we investigate the significant excess of clusters detected in the local WARPS sample.
We construct and fit the eRASS:1 XLF, and conclude that the excess does not persist . 
Further analysis is required to understand the origin of the excess in K13, along with an improved selection function to better analyse the eRASS:1 catalogue.
